             :description "Programming, software development, and software engineering: We are taught to solve puzzles and do what we’re told. We carry these lessons into our jobs and careers without deliberation. Old fashioned software engineering aims to make no mistakes; agile aims to render programmers compliant, and commands them make money for their bosses. For the past year I’ve been exploring what creativity means during the act of writing, and I’ve been doing it by constructing a software partner that acts as a scientific engine of discovery — a partner that displays a flair for the strange that even the most daring poets can rarely match. I don’t have requirements, I don’t have specifications, and I normally don’t have a plan much beyond a guess. If my program doesn’t surprise me, I cry “failure!” and lament.

I’ll explore what programming is, how software can act as a collaborator, show you how the agile practices are like training wheels, and explain how a program can astound.

All in Lisp, of course.")

We take a seemingly random walk along the different paths, watch the scenery of pairwise interactions unfold and piece a puzzle together. In the purely speculative thread, we compare models of parallel computation, keeping an eye on their applicability and lisp support. In the the Python and R envy thread, we detail why lisp could be a better vehicle for scientific programming and how high performance computing is eroding lisp's largely unrealized competitive advantages. Switching to constructive mode, a basic data structure is proposed as a first step.

In the machine learning thread, lisp's unparalleled interactive capabilities meet contests, neural networks cross threads and all get in the way of the presentation.")

However, Lisp usage has been progressively discontinued with the development of new branches in mainstream computer music such as digital signal processing, real-time systems or distributed multimedia computing.

The power and expressivity of Lisp make it a valuable language to musicians for exploring high-level compositional processes, and this language remains a fundamental support for computer-aided composition research and creation at Ircam.

In this session we propose to present an overview of current computer-aided music composition projects, and discuss with ELS attendees the challenges, issues and perspectives for using Lisp in aforementioned music technologies.")
