SUMMARY:Asynchronous Programming in Dart
DESCRIPTION:Florian Loitsch has a passion for dynamic languages, like 
 Scheme, JavaScript and now Dart. He wrote a Scheme-to-JavaScript compi
 ler during his thesis, and then completed a JavaScript-to-Scheme compi
 ler in his spare time.\n\nIn 2010 he joined Google's team in Aarhus (D
 enmark) where he worked on V8 and later Dart. Being part of the Dart t
 eam Florian has helped specifying the language, which was presented in
  late 2011. In 2012 he became the Tech Lead for the Dart libraries whe
 re, among other tasks, he participated on the creation of a new asynch
 ronous library that is based on Streams and Futures (aka promises).

SUMMARY:Streams-Based, Multi-Threaded News Classification
DESCRIPTION:Streams are a way of organizing indefinite collections of 
 data such that each item can naturally flow through a network of compu
 tations. Using some simple abstractions, we construct a computation ne
 twork that operates on streams with each node being handled by a separ
 ate computation thread. The result is efficient, maintainable and all 
 done in Common Lisp.\n\nThe financial industry is hungry to trade on n
 ews, but often ill-equipped to do so. The continuous publication of ne
 ws is like big data in real time. RavenPack processes this flow and pr
 oduces actionable News Analytics for any industry with an appetite for
  news. Jason Cornez joined RavenPack in 2003 to solve real-world probl
 ems using Common Lisp.

SUMMARY:Lisp and Music Research
DESCRIPTION:Lisp has long been and still is a privileged language for 
 building "experiments in musical intelligence", to quote the title of 
 a book by David Cope, a famous researcher in the field. Thus its use i
 n several "Computer Assisted Composition" systems or more generally fo
 r environments oriented towards the modelisation, representation, anal
 ysis and generation of music. Although the choice of Lisp has been gen
 erally reserved to high level, symbolic and formal representations, it
  is also possible to benefit from this powerful functional language pa
 radigm and from its characteristic data / program duality (think of th
 e musical duality between structures and processes) in complex setups,
  where the whole range of representations and time scales is invoked f
 rom the acoustic signal to the formal organisation. Some interesting p
 ast and present systems will be presented in this perspective, includi
 ng OpenMusic and OMax, designed by the author with his team at IRCAM.\
 n\nGerard Assayag is the founder of the Music Representations Team at 
 Ircam, where he has designed with his collaborators OpenMusic and OMax
 , two lisp based environments which have become international standard
 s for computer assisted music composition / analysis and for music imp
 rovisation. He is head of the Ircam STMS research Lab since Jan 2011. 
 Ircam is the biggest joint facility for music research and production 
 in the world, where many leading technologies and softwares have been 
 created.
